Troy SieglerINFO 3401Problem set 21. The cd indicates Òchange directoryÓ and takes us from users down into INFO3401. However, next we use the Ò..Ó function which takes us back to our parent dictionary (in this case it is usrs). From here we go into the dictionary titled ÒhomeworkÓ and then following this we use the Ò.Ó function to move relative to another part of our current dictionary (homework) which is titled Òproblem1Ó. pwd prints the current directory that we are in so assuming all of the irectories in this problem are valid the function should output:/usrs/homework/problem12. One way to override the permission issue is to use the sudo (superuser do) command. The sudo command overrides any sort of permission on specific files on the computer and make them available to you. The first command you will use will follow in this format: sudo command -options files. In our particular case we are not given the command or option, but we do have the file names. Initially, It would most likely be best to move to the home directory before beginning (using the .. or ~ command). After that is done, our command will look something like this: sudo command -options datasets/activedata. After this, our terminal will ask for your password to ensure that it is you and then, if all the contents are correct, the command should finally work and override any permission restrictions. 3. The first command will take us to our home dictionary followed by a ÒmkdirÓ command that will create a dictionary titled Òproblem_set_1Ó within the current home dictionary. Then within the directory we are currently in, we will use the ÒtouchÓ command to create an empty file within said directory titled Òsubmissions.txtÓ. After this we use the .. function to take us back to our parent directory and we input pwd to show us where we are. The output will be your home directory. (For me, I got /Users/troysiegler)4. cd /cp ~/config.txtThese commands above will copy the document Òconfig.txtÓ from my home directory to my root directory. cd /mkdir preferencesThis command creates a directory titled ÒpreferencesÓ within the root directorycd preferencescp ~/prefs.txtThis command copies the file Òprefs.txtÓ from a matching directory called preferences in my home directory. Lastly, to ensure that the start and end of the config.txt document in both root and home match, I will use the ls function within both directories and examine the two files and make sure that they match up.5. I should have used the cp ~/Documents/ datafile.csv command to copy the file into my current directory. However, I accidentally used the mv ~/Documents/ datafile.csv command. In order to ÒundoÓ what I have done, I am simply going to move the file back to its original directory and then use the copy function that I listed above in order to achieve what I was going for. 6. The script accesses the commands that were typed in the Òasciify-masterÓ file which outputs a cat that is made up of text figures. (screenshot below)7. In order to install the Delorean Python Package is used the Òpip install DeloreanÓ command within my terminal. After that, I lauched python and and executed:from delorean import DeloreanEST = "US/Eastern"d = Delorean(timezone=EST)print(d)After I put this into my command line, this is what prints out:Delorean(datetime=datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 12, 0, 16, 25, 914646), timezone='US/Eastern')8. The command that I used to download all of the World Bank data was:wget https://finances.worldbank.org/api/views/yu93-ayrw/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOADThis was my outcome (and the downloaded file will be attached in the GitHub submission):9. The command that I used was:	grep Total World_Bank_Expenditures_by_Organizational_Unit.csv	The total number of rows was 56.10. The command used was cat *csv | grep Total > distilledExpenditures.csv
